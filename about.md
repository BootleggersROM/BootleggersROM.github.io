	<p>Bootleggers ROM is a AOSP based ROM with some extra patches anf features from other projects, like LineageOS, Dirty Unicorns, PixelExperience, OmniROM, and many more. Our goal is trying to add the best to make you feel like å®¶. With all those feature, we also have some extra apps, themes and wallpapers to try to give you a great experience since the first boot.</p><br>
	<p>The project began as a small project for the Moto E 2015 (LTE) back on Android 8.0 but then various users and maintainers got interested on supporting our project. Our source is constanly changing and upgrading thanks to various testers and maintainers with reports and commits needed for their devices, but in case we're missing something, please let us know on our instagram or telegram chat.</p><br>
	<p>Our work wouldn't be possible thanks to our community of maintainers, testers or people who enjoy this custom ROM.</p><br>
