Hey everyone! This is a small heads up about the 7.1 release. 

I'll try to make it short as it's a small number bump, as we merged Android's march security patch, which brought a lot of changes. 

We also, took some time and effort to rework on things like our launcher and did a bit of cleanup. More things coming soon for 7.2! Also, april patch is around the corner, we'll merge as soon as we can, but we wanted to let you know that finally, the 7.1 release is here!

Gotta thank our team for all the effort for testing and making sure everything was ready for this release. About maintainers, you'll get news this week, new devices supported soon, we'll let you know on our [telegram chat](https://t.me/keepthebootleg).

This is the highlight of our changelog of this release:
