Hey everyone! We decided to go out of the lab this time, it's been a while since we'vbe posted an update. This release is called [Night Drive](https://cutt.ly/yL56Rk3) because we've been working a lot and we needed to take a bit of fresh air. 

Now, we know that jumping from 5.2 to 7.0 looks a bit weird but, that's because we were secretly working on bringing up new releases back on android R and S, but the reason why these releases never went out of the lab is because we never got them in a pretty good state to post them on our main source. But we'll tell you more about it soon.

## Things done changed. But the å®¶ is always there

While we were on the lab, we've went through the whole Android 12 UI changes and everything changed aesthetically. Our themes were nice but a lot of things got broken in the way too. So, for now, we're shipping our UI styles in a half-baked state, but don't fret. There are things coming soon, as [we've teased in our Telegram channel](https://t.me/keepthebootlegchannel/440), so stay tuned. 

We were working on Project Optronic, which is a take on monet with a lot of inspiration from themes like Valerie and Quetzal, where you have transparency on your backgrounds but this time the color is taken from your wallpaper. You can get a lot of crazy combos with this. Here's a [small preview of Optronic in action](https://t.me/keepthebootlegchannel/435). See how the background is greenish like the background. Go crazy with it.

Also, we got custom lock screen fonts, which started with bringing back a Bootleg classic: [GoBold in the lockscreen lock](https://t.me/keepthebootlegchannel/41). Now, since Android 12 there was support for a custom font in the new HUGE lockscreen clock, so we took a chance and brought back [this clock font in this new release](https://t.me/keepthebootlegchannel/428), and after some recent security patch, Google made this change into a overlay. So, we've decided to [have fun with this](https://t.me/keepthebootlegchannel/437). [Twice](https://t.me/keepthebootlegchannel/443). Little did we knew that this will be turned into a future feature in a future Android release. So, we've shipped more fonts to combine with the system font and this huge clock design.

Also, we've dropped the ShishuWalls app in favor of a custom Wallpaper provider on the system, now we have consistency of having a category for wallpapers. The bad thing is we have to update it manually, but maybe something will be worked to get that in a dynamic way, including more works and designs from [our community of wallpaper designers](https://t.me/BTLGWalls), and there's more planned and to be included. But for that, we need a bit of help...

## With a Little Help...

We've posted about this on our TG channel but now we're extending it to this post. **We're searching for new device maintainers and new team members**. Previously, all the work was mostly done by ElDainosor (with a lot of help of maintainers that also got life events) and well, time and life got him busy, that made the Bootleggers quality to drop due to lack of features or missing things, it wasn't up to our standars. So, that's why we're searching for new people to help us keeping the bootleg alive, from keeping source up to date, to taking care of maintainers and things like the website, or even, helping us out with adding and testing features, or improving our current ones. Any help is appreciated, and as always, we know this is a free project that's being maintained on our free time, so, if you're interested on working on our source or help us with management or graphic design, feel free to [let us know in this form](https://forms.gle/a3qb9m6yacdrKP8w9).

As for device maintainers, we need you more than ever. Now we're sort of starting fresh, so, if you're interested in releasing bootleg officially, feel free to [let us know in this form](https://forms.gle/QxxHjqr5o8F85hGb9) too.

In the meantime, hope you enjoy this release, we'll get new shishufied builds going out soon, and besides taking way too long to officially release something stable for you, hope you still keep the bootleg and have a nice week!

*Special thanks to tribual and ouroboros420 for all the help to make it a really good and stable experience, but this is just the beginning. #BringTheShishuBack*
