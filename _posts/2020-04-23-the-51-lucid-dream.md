Hey these, welcome back to another post about this new release. This release is called [**Lucid Dream**](https://cutt.ly/2ytT88E) as it's a song that actually relates to our goal with this release. We've been through a lot of thoughts and testing during this release, and we hope you like the final result, as our approach with it was... simply coming back to our roots, but more on that later. First of all we have to thank our team members, dinosnore, simrat39 and tribual and our maintainers for their contributions, and hard work testing. Without their help and testing, this release couldn't get out faster. Now, let's talk about some changes...

## Small changes that makes a difference

Let's start with something about our goal with this release, something that our ROM was missing was some UI things. Like, we're on Android 10, the AOSP team left that interesting app called Theme Picker, and it has some cool things like clocks and stuff, why not have fun with that? So we did. We decided to experiment with one thing, that was the clock. We've made some designs based on one thing: Aesthetics and functionality. Because something is good looking doesn't mean it's useful or handy. So, we gave our best, we learn about how the clock part works, and we tried to do our best to bring up some quality clocks. Hope you enjoy them. And with all this new ground to play, we decided to also bring up lockscreen clock fonts. So, have fun tweaking that to our needs. But beware! Something we noticed during our testing phase is that the date/weather part has some issues (like showing up even if it was disabled, or our custom designs not having the weather because we had to do some custom date views), and it was a bit hard to implement the weather in the clocks (we're still researching about how clockplugin works, so we're sorry) or how to workaround things. But we'll give our best to get things done. Also, get ready for some new things to pick on ThemePicker soon, we have some fun projects to work until we get to the new android release, so stay tuned!

As a tradition, we added a wallpaper app, for now it's just some quality wallpapers from the community, and all the wallpapers made during our releases. Some are good, some are... bad. But those are there regardless. Also, there's a few surprises, so check it out. Maybe in the future we'll have a wallpaper app that checks for new walls from our channel? Who knows >:] For now, enjoy them. Oh, also, here's the changelog about what's being added or changes since our release.
