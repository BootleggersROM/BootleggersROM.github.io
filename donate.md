    <h3>Support our Project</h3>
	<p>Bootleggers is a small open source project that's being mostly done by ElDainosor. Most of the artistic decisions (default wallpapers, accents, themes) are done by him, obviously most of the features are being done by other projects (which we have to thank from the bottom of our hearts for their hard work) and well, this project tries to mix up everything in a single package to make you feel like å®¶.</p><br>
	<p>Even though most of the time the code isn't our own code, we try to give the spin to things and we're glad that you're enjoying it. We'll work to see if we can bring some new stuff on the table because android is a wonderful place, you know?</p><br>
	<p>Everything on this project is being tested completely on a Moto E 2015 (LTE Variant) and being worked on by hopping between Google Cloud trials for almost 2 years now, it's not the ideal thing but hey, we got this far and we want to help to each of every one of those people who helped us to continue working, and keep growing up... even though is not a good environment to work on something that requires a lot of dedication like this project.</p><br>
	<p>If you want to support our project, feel free to donate to ElDainosor's PayPal, all of the funds will be dedicated to supporting this project, like getting a domain, to having a server to host useful stuff to expand our workflow like Gerrit, improving the hosting service of the server so that you all don't have any problem regarding to our site"s service or in a extreme scenario, try to get a new device or even a build machine to have an actual workplace and put all the efforts into working without any hassle.</p><br>
